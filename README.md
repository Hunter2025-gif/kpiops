Secondary Packaging → Final QA → Finished Goods
```

#### 2. Tablets Production (Normal & Type 2)
```
BMR Creation → Regulatory Approval → Material Release → Dispensing →
Granulation → Blending → Compression → QC Testing → Sorting →
[Coating (if needed)] → Packaging Release → [Blister/Bulk Packing] →
Secondary Packaging → Final QA → Finished Goods
```

#### 3. Capsules Production
```
BMR Creation → Regulatory Approval → Material Release → Dispensing →
